## 🎯 Project Summary  
This project was developed during the Karu Hackathon, focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence to solve a **tangible challenge**.  
The solution demonstrates full-stack capability, algorithmic thinking, data processing, and deployment readiness—ideal for a remote programming role.

---

## 🧰 Key Features  
- **AI/ML Model Integration**: Uses a trained model to make predictions or recommendations relevant to the hackathon problem.  
- **Backend API**: Node.js or other JavaScript framework to handle requests, serve data, and manage logic.  
- **Interactive Frontend**: A user‐friendly interface to input data, receive results, and visualize outcomes.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays status, results and analytics for each input processed.  
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be deployed on cloud services or used as prototype for production.

⚙️ Setup & Usage
🔹 Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14+)

npm or yarn
```
🔹 Installation
bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/ManuCodello/Hackathon-Karu-IA.git  
cd Hackathon-Karu-IA/backend  
npm install  
🔹 Running Locally
bash
Copiar código
npm start            # starts backend  
# In separate terminal  
cd ../frontend  

open index.html      # or serve via a static server  
```
🔹 Usage
Navigate to the frontend in your browser

Input the required data for the hackathon challenge

Submit & wait for the AI model to respond

View predictions/results and analytics

🧠 Technical Highlights
Model trained with [specify library: TensorFlow.js, ONNX.js, etc.]

Data pipeline to clean, normalize and structure inputs

API endpoints exposed for inference and analytics

Frontend built for clarity and responsiveness using plain JS/CSS

🚀 What You Learned
How to design and deploy an AI-powered application from idea to prototype

How to integrate ML models into web apps

How to handle full-stack workflow: backend, frontend, data, deployment

How to prepare a solution under time constraints (hackathon setting) — demonstrates agility and practicality

✔️ Future Improvements
Add user authentication and dashboard for tracking multiple use-cases

Expand the model or train additional models for broader scope

Deploy the app as a PWA or mobile version

Improve logging, testing, and CI/CD for production readiness
